  # Functions to construct the MongoDB field key for trackers
  #
  # to_i_timestamp returns the computed UTC timestamp regardless of the
  # timezone.
  #
  # Examples:
  #    2011-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  ===> 14975
  #    2011-01-01 23:59:59 UTC  ===> 14975
  #    2011-01-02 00:00:00 UTC  ===> 14976
  # 
  # to_i_hour returns the hour for the date, again regardless of TZ
  #
  #    2011-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  ===> 0
  #    2011-01-01 23:59:59 UTC  ===> 23
